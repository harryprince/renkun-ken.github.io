Finally I set up my blog website hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). It is quite amazing to create a website totally for free. After some trial and error, now I come up with a stable workflow to publish my work, introductory materials, and random thoughts online. 

The contents of my postings will be related to data science, statistical programming, quantitative finance, and relevant topics. I will try to strike a balance between theory and application.

If you are a finance student, I hope my blogs will help improve your ability of implementation. If you are a student with the background of computer science and want to do something in finance, I hope my blogs will make sense and offer much intuition.

Anyway, welcome to my homepage!
