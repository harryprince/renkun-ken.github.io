Twelve days after the initial commit, [pipeR tutorial](/pipeR-tutorial) is released! 

If you want to write R code fluently and process data elegantly, I strongly recommend that you read this tutorial which is designed to serve as a complete guide to [pipeR](/pipeR) package, including how it works with [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr), [rlist](/rlist), and [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) with vivid examples.

You can also provide suggestions at the [issue page](https://github.com/renkun-ken/pipeR-tutorial/issues) or [fork](https://github.com/renkun-ken/pipeR-tutorial/fork) and contribute.

Now I have started working on [rlist-tutorial](/rlist-tutorial) which is yet far from complete.
