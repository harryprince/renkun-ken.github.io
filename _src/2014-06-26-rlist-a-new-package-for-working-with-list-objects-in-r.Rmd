In recent years, non-relational data have attracted more and more attentions. Roughly speaking, all datasets that are hard to put into a rectangular table with rows and columns are non-relational datasets.

The following data is a very simple non-relational dataset in JSON format. The dataset contains some information of three programmers, each of whom has a name, an age, some interests, and a list of programming languages with the number of years used.

```json
{
  "p1" : {
  	"name" : "Ken",
		"age" : 24,
		"interest" : [
			"reading",
			"music",
			"movies"
		],
		"lang" : {
			"r" : 2,
			"csharp" : 4,
			"python" : 3
		}
	},
	"p2" : {
		"name" : "James",
		"age" : 25,
		"interest" : [
			"sports",
			"music"
		],
		"lang" : {
			"r" : 3,
			"java" : 2,
			"cpp" : 5
		}
	},
	"p3" : {
		"name" : "Penny",
		"age" : 24,
		"interest" : [
			"movies",
			"reading"
		],
		"lang" : {
			"r" : 1,
			"cpp" : 4,
			"python" : 2
		}
	}
}
```

It takes efforts to fit such a dataset into several relational data tables. If we really need to do so, we may create a table of names and ages, a table of interests, and a table of languages, and use some relations to represent how the records in every table corresponds to each other.

One of the most popular solution for processing non-relational data structures is MongoDB, which uses JSON/BSON format to store such kind of data and use similar syntax to query the dataset.

In R, list object is powerful enough to represent a wide range of non-relational datasets like this. In the recent month, I have been working on a new package called [rlist](http://renkun.me/rlist) hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/renkun-ken/rlist). It is a set of tools for working with list objects.

This package has two main goals:

- Make it easier to work with list objects used to store data in more flexible structures than data frames.
- Perform a wide range of functions on non-relational data using list constructs.

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("rlist")
```

or install the latest development version from GitHub with

```r
devtools::install_github("rlist","renkun-ken")
```

## Functions

The package provides a wide range of functions to work with list objects. Suppose we work with the developers dataset we just mentioned.

```{r}
library(rlist)
devs <-
  list(
    p1=list(name="Ken",age=24,
      interest=c("reading","music","movies"),
      lang=list(r=2,csharp=4,python=3)),
    p2=list(name="James",age=25,
      interest=c("sports","music"),
      lang=list(r=3,java=2,cpp=5)),
    p3=list(name="Penny",age=24,
      interest=c("movies","reading"),
      lang=list(r=1,cpp=4,python=2)))
```

### Filtering

Filter members whose age is no less than 25 by calling `list.filter`.

```{r}
str(list.filter(devs,age >= 25))
```

### Mapping

Get the name of each person by calling `list.map` that maps each member by an expression.

```{r}
list.map(devs, name)
```

Get the programming language each person has been using for the longest time by calling `list.map`.

```{r}
list.map(devs, sort(unlist(lang),decreasing = T)[1])
```

### Selecting

Select the name and age of each member by calling `list.select`.

```{r}
str(list.select(devs,name,age))
```

Select the name and evaluate the range of the number of years using programming languages.

```{r}
str(list.select(devs,name,score.range=range(unlist(lang))))
```

### Grouping

Build a list that contains sublists each represents an age group by calling `list.group`.

```{r}
str(list.group(devs,age))
```

### Sorting

Sort the developers by the number of interests in descending order, then by the number of years they have been using R in descending order by calling `list.sort`.

```{r}
str(list.sort(devs,desc(length(interest)),desc(lang$r)))
```

### Updating

Use `list.update` to update the list by removing `age` and `lang` columns and introducing the number of languages each member uses as `nlang`.

```{r}
str(list.update(devs,age=NULL,lang=NULL,nlang=length(lang)))
```

### More functions

Much more functions are provided than the examples show. Please read the documentation of the package.

### Working with pipeline

Pipeline operators may hugely improve the readibility of the code especially when a chain of commands are executed. [pipeR package](http://renkun.me/pipeR) is recommended to co-work with this package.

The following code returns the developers whose age is no more than 24 and create a data frame where they are sorted by the number of years using R in descending order and each row tells us the name, years of using R, and the longest time using a language they know.

```{r}
library(pipeR)
devs %>>%
  list.filter(age <= 24) %>>%
  list.sort(desc(lang$r)) %>>%
  list.map(data.frame(name=name,r=lang$r,
    longest=max(unlist(lang)))) %>>%
  list.rbind
```

### Lambda expression

Most functions in this package supports lambda expressions like `x ~ f(x)`  where `x` refers to the list member itself. Otherwise, `.` will by default be used to represent it.

```{r}
nums <- list(a=c(1,2,3),b=c(2,3,4),c=c(3,4,5))
nums %>>%
  list.map(data.frame(min=min(.),max=max(.))) %>>%
  list.rbind
nums %>>%
  list.map(x ~ sum(x))
nums %>>%
  list.filter(x ~ mean(x)>=3)
```

## Conclusion

rlist package can be used to deal with list objects in a very flexible and streamlined manner. It can work together with many other packages such as pipeR, plyr, dplyr, etc.
